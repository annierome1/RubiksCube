Run project in src/test/RubiksGT/Main.java

This project implements a bidirectional search algorithm to solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube puzzle. The algorithm is based on a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-Limited Search (DLS), and it leverages a bidirectional search strategy to efficiently find a solution by expanding two search trees: one starting from the scrambled state and the other from the solved state. The ultimate goal is to find a meeting point between the two search trees, which represents a valid solution to the Rubik's Cube
